#BASIC ALGORITHM:
#
# 1. Take in an image -> detector -> detected boxes. Normalize the boxes.
# 2. Divide boxes into high and low confidence boxes.
# 3. The high confidence boxes are matched first with the predictions of the tracks.
# 4. Next the remaining tracks are matched with the low confidence boxes (maybe occluded objects)
# 5. Finally the *last observations* (OC-recovery) of the remaining tracks are matched with the
#    remaining high confidence boxes.
# 6. Any remaining high confidence boxes are used to create new tracks.
# 7. Tracks are updated with new boxes.
# 8. All the tracks that have a streak of detections > threshold (=3) are considered "proper"
#   tracks and are returned/added to the image.
